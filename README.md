# BLU03 - Workflows 

## What is in this BLU? 
This week we will focus on how to predict timeseries in the real World. The objective is to prepare you for the hackathon, so the exercises will be very practical, as will the materials.

Regarding the Learning Notebooks, treat Part 2 as optional for solving the exercises, but do read it before the hackathon if you want to have a few more tools in your toolbox. 

The exercises in the Exercise Notebooks are VERY similar to the type of problem you will get in the hackathon. If you are able to solve this BLU, you should be ready to do and predict some timeseries :) 


## How to use this repo 
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (they are in the Learning Notebooks folder)
2. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](http://portal.lisbondatascience.org) as usual
